MOCK SQL QUERY:
    select * from breweries where brewery_type = "micro" and country = "Canada";

Took roughly 2 hours, didn't really run into any problems. Can't think of any 
notable decisions I made as there's no real content here haha. Added 2 new 
routers (and their routes), some basic messages to show the user when they hit 
the routes. Let me know if you have any questions ðŸ™‚

The brewery API only accepts certain values for the "type", so if the user sends 
a bad value through and the brewery API gives us an error, I cought it with a 
general 400 error to mask the crap the brewery API gives us. Probably don't need 
(or want) to do this if this API was only used internally in your Kegshoe app, 
for example. 

I've only built an API in JS before, which is why I picked it for this test. I'd 
be interested to see the inner workings of Kegshoe's APIs in PHP ðŸ˜‰ sounds JUICY

Hope to speak with whoever is reading this soon!
